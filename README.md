# BIKESHARE
Citibike with Tableu

## BACKGROUND
My Friend Kate and I are inspired to start a bike share company after riding bikes in New York on vacation. 

We use Citi Bike data that has been released to the public for our analysis. Caution will be used when looking at the data, as it applies specifically to New York Cityâ€”Des Moines is quite different! Were excited to find out which data will and will not apply to Des Moines, drawing on both your data expertise and critical thinking skills. 

## METHOD

We will be using the analytic tool Tableau for this project. 

Since August is a beautiful time of the year to rent a bike, we want to use this data as a starting point to determine how many rides we could expect in the city of Des Moines.

## Questions
* How long do users bike for?
* When are users using the bikes?
* Who is using the bikes?
* Where are they biking to and from?

 



## Results

##### How long do users bike for?

The following chart shows the length of time of every bike ride during the month of August in 2019. Wee can see that riders typically like to bike between 2 and 15 minutes.

##### When are the bikes being used?
The following chart clearly illustrates when the bikes are used the most, and when they are not actively being used. This can help us determine which hours are good for maintenance. Based on the chart the best hours to perform maintenance is 2:00 to 4:00 am.

##### Who is using the bikes?

The following charts illustrate that men are by far the most common users of Citi Bike. Furthermore the most frequent day of the week that men ride is Thursday.

##### Where are they biking to and from?
These two visualizations show the more congested starting and ending locations. The first thing to note is that most rides start in the most populous areas in mid and lower Manhattan. Second, the ending locations are also in those same populated areas. 

#### Summary
Key Takaways are as follows;
The predominant users are males in their 20s. This information could be useful for maketing. 
Most of the rides are short and happen in the city center. Bikes that end up in less popular areas should be redistributed to the center so that the supply can meet the demand. 
Thursday is the most popular day for city bikes, marketing could offer incentives or promotions on the less active days
The least active hours are 2-4am. Those hours would be optimal for bike repairs or redistrubution towards the city center.
