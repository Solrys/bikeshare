# BIKESHARE
Citibike with Tableu

## BACKGROUND
My Friend Kate and I are inspired to start a bike share company after riding bikes in New York on vacation. 

We use Citi Bike data that has been released to the public for our analysis. Caution will be used when looking at the data, as it applies specifically to New York Cityâ€”Des Moines is quite different! Were excited to find out which data will and will not apply to Des Moines, drawing on both your data expertise and critical thinking skills. 

## METHOD

We will be using the analytic tool Tableau for this project. 

Since August is a beautiful time of the year to rent a bike, we want to use this data as a starting point to determine how many rides we could expect in the city of Des Moines.

## Questions
* How long do users bike for?
* Who is using the bikes?
* Where are they biking to and from?
* When are users using the bikes?
 



## Results

##### How long do users bike for?

The following chart shows the length of time of every bike ride during the month of August in 2019. Wee can see that riders typically like to bike between 2 and 15 minutes.
